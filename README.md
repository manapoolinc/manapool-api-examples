# manapool-api-examples

"Example Code - Use at Your Own Risk"
These examples demonstrate Manapool API capabilities for educational purposes. They are not supported software and may break with API updates.
Support Boundaries:

✅ API questions: Documentation, authentication, endpoint behavior
❌ Example code questions: Implementation issues, debugging, customization

Maintenance Policy:

Examples reflect current API version at time of creation
May break during major API releases without notice
Updates provided on best-effort basis only
No guarantees of compatibility or functionality

Intended Use:

Educational reference to show what's possible
Starting points for your own development
Demonstrations of API capabilities, not production patterns
